LruCache
========

LruCache is a thread-safe, in-memory
[httpcache.Cache](https://github.com/gregjones httpcache) implementation that evicts the least recently used entries when a byte size limit would be exceeded.

See the [godoc documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/die-net/lrucache) for more detail.

Also included are a test suite with close to 100% test coverage and a parallel benchmark suite that can be used to verify thread-safely. Benchmarks show individual Set, Get, and Delete operations take under 500ns to complete.
